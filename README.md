# Text Tools

Small client-side utility app to manipulate text: paste, copy, format JSON, unescape sequences.

Local dev:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build & preview:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the app and publishes `dist/` to GitHub Pages when you push to `main`.
